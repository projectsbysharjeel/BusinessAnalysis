# BusinessAnalysis

# Short description of the project

Student groups analyse a real business and through systematic fact finding and documentation identify operational and strategic issues within that business. 
They then undertake a holistic strategic analysis of the business to identify possible future directions for the company. 
In this activity students will be exposed to peer learning and will develop oral communication skills and the ability to record data, 
synthesise an opinion, and convey this clearly in a well presented and articulate manner.
